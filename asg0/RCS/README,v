Make sure you know how to submit files.  Submit these files
to asg0.  Verify that the submit actually worked by looking
in the submit directory for your username.

The find(1) command is very useful for things like this.

This asg0 will not be graded and there is no credit for it.
Experience with Unix is assumed.  Attend a lab section to ask
questions if you don't understand how submit works.
